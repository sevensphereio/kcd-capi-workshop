Usage: $0 --yes

This script will DELETE the resources this module created. It is
idempotent — re-running it is safe.

  - Always prefer running cleanup BEFORE retrying a module.
  - The kind management cluster is not touched here unless this is
    module-01-introduction's cleanup. Use ../cleanup-all.sh for a
    full reset.
USAGE
    exit 0

echo ">>> module-01: nuking the kind management cluster (capi-mgmt)"

rm -f kind-config.yaml
echo "module-01 cleanup done."
